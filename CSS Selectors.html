        <h1>CSS Selectors</h1>
        <h4>CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.</h4>
        
        We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
        <li>
        Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class). </li>
        <li>Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them).</li>
        <li>Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state).</li>
        <li>Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element).</li>
        <li>Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value).</li>
        This page will explain the most basic CSS selectors.

        <p>Every paragraph will be affected by the style.</p>
